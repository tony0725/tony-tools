# Tony Tools

Hello, I'm tony. I use ruby shell to write some tool to help me quick finish my work. if there has any tools you need, you can clone to your computer and use. (Sorry.. poor english)

# Setup

Open your terminal, and switch to your home:

```
cd ~
```

Now, clone this git:

```
git clone git@github.com:tony0725/tony-tools.git
```

When it done, you need add `tony-tools` to your terminal's PATH.

Edit your `~/.zshrc` and add this line in your file:

```
path=($HOME/tony-tools/bin $path)
```

Done!
